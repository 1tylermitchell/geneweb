<h1>GeneWeb - Problem</h1>

A frequently encountered problem is the following:

<p>

You launched the <em>GeneWeb</em> daemon "gwd" and it answers normally
as indicated in the chapter "How to start with GeneWeb", section
"Command <a href="start.htm#Gwd">gwd</a>".

<h4> Problem </h4>

When you enter the address in your navigator, e.g.:

<p>

<pre>
     http://localhost:2317/smith
</pre>

The navigator answers that you have to connect to the network, and that it
cannot work off line.

<p>

This problem happens with some versions of Internet Explorer.

<h4> Solution </h4>

Maybe depending on the version you have, we received from
<em>GeneWeb</em> users (thank you) the following solutions:

<p>

<ul><li> Under Internet Explorer, select the menu "Display", "Internet
options".  Then, in menu "Connection", active "do not use proxy for
local addresses".</ul>

<p>

<ul><li> [Version 3.02] Under Internet Explorer, select the menu
"Display", "Options", "Connection". Then go to "Proxyserver" and
select "Setup", add under "Exceptions" and "Proxyserver not to be used
for addresses beginning with" the addresses given when you start
gwd.exe. For example (note the semicolons between names):
<pre>
     127.0.0.1;localhost;computer
</pre>
 </ul>

<p>

If it does not work better, we suggest you to use another navigator,
e.g. Netscape (which is free now).
